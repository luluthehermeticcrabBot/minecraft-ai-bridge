# Agent Internals

This document explains how the AI agent works under the hood — the loop, action system, goal management, memory, and state formatting.

## The Think-Act-Observe Loop

The agent runs a continuous loop in `Orchestrator._step()`:

```
┌──────────────┐
│   Observe    │  ← Gather world state via MCPQ (position, inventory, etc.)
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│    Think     │  ← Send context to LLM, get action decision
│  (LLM call)  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│     Act      │  ← Execute chosen action via MCPQ
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   Record     │  ← Store in memory, check completion
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       └──→ Repeat until done or max_iterations
```

### Context Sent to the LLM

On each turn, the LLM receives:

1. **System prompt** — role definition, action catalog, output format rules
2. **Goal context** — the overall goal and current sub-goal
3. **World state** — formatted summary of position, health, inventory, time, nearby blocks
4. **Recent actions** — last N actions and their results (short-term memory)
5. **Notable facts** — persistent discoveries from long-term memory
6. **Last action result** — what happened the previous turn

Example world state format:

```
=== World State ===
Position: (0.0, 65.0, 0.0)
Health: 20.0 / 20.0
Time: 1000 (Day)
Players: [AIBot]
Inventory: (empty or item count)
Nearby blocks:
  north: dirt   south: dirt
  east: stone   west: dirt
  front_eye: air
  d+2z+2: grass_block
```

### LLM Response

The LLM returns a structured response:

```json
{
  "action": "place_block",
  "action_params": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 65,
    "z": 3,
    "block_type": "oak_planks"
  },
  "reasoning": "I need to build the north wall. The floor is at (0,64,0). I'll place planks at the north edge."
}
```

The `action` field must match an `ActionType` enum value. The `action_params` must match the handler's expected parameters.

## Action System

### ActionType Enum

Defined in `minecraft/actions.py`:

```python
class ActionType(str, Enum):
    MOVE_TO = "move_to"
    MOVE_FORWARD = "move_forward"
    MOVE_BACK = "move_back"
    TURN_LEFT = "turn_left"
    TURN_RIGHT = "turn_right"
    JUMP = "jump"
    TELEPORT = "teleport"
    BREAK_BLOCK = "break_block"
    PLACE_BLOCK = "place_block"
    INTERACT = "interact"
    CHECK_INVENTORY = "check_inventory"
    EQUIP_ITEM = "equip_item"
    CRAFT_ITEM = "craft_item"
    DROP_ITEM = "drop_item"
    ATTACK = "attack"
    SCAN = "scan"
    CHECK_TIME = "check_time"
    CHECK_WEATHER = "check_weather"
    CHECK_HEALTH = "check_health"
    CHECK_POSITION = "check_position"
    LIST_PLAYERS = "list_players"
    CHAT = "chat"
    WAIT = "wait"
    DONE = "done"
```

### Action Parameters

Each action expects specific parameters:

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `move_to` | `x`, `y`, `z` (float) | Teleport to coordinates |
| `move_forward` | `steps` (int, default 2) | Move forward N blocks |
| `move_back` | `steps` (int, default 2) | Move back N blocks |
| `turn_left` | — | Rotate 90 degrees left |
| `turn_right` | — | Rotate 90 degrees right |
| `jump` | — | Move up 1 block |
| `teleport` | `x`, `y`, `z` (float) | Same as move_to |
| `break_block` | `x`, `y`, `z` (int, optional) | Break block at coords or in front |
| `place_block` | `x`, `y`, `z` (int, optional), `block_type` (string) | Place block |
| `interact` | — | Right-click interaction |
| `check_inventory` | — | List inventory contents |
| `equip_item` | `slot` (int) | Equip item from hotbar slot |
| `craft_item` | `item_type` (string), `amount` (int) | Give item to player |
| `drop_item` | `item_type` (string), `amount` (int) | Remove items from inventory |
| `attack` | — | Attack target entity |
| `scan` | `radius` (int, max 16) | Scan nearby blocks |
| `check_time` | — | Get game time |
| `check_weather` | — | Get weather state |
| `check_health` | — | Get player health |
| `check_position` | — | Get player coordinates |
| `list_players` | — | List online players |
| `chat` | `message` (string) | Send chat message |
| `wait` | `seconds` (float) | Do nothing for N seconds |
| `done` | `message` (string) | Mark task complete |

### ActionResult

Every action returns an `ActionResult`:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionResult:
    success: bool
    action: ActionType
    message: str
    data: dict     # Action-specific data (position, inventory, etc.)
```

## Goal System

### GoalNode Tree

```python
class GoalNode:
    description: str       # "Gather wood"
    completed: bool        # True when done action succeeds for this goal
    sub_goals: list[GoalNode]  # Children for decomposition
    parent: GoalNode | None    # Back-reference for traversal
```

### Decomposition Flow

1. User provides goal (e.g., "Build a house")
2. `GoalManager.set_goal()` sends to LLM:
   > "Break down 'Build a house' into 3-8 concrete sub-goals. Return as JSON array of strings."
3. If LLM returns valid JSON array → those become sub-goals
4. If LLM fails or returns nothing → fallback plans match by keyword

### Fallback Plans

Built-in fallback decomposition plans in `goal_manager.py`:

| Pattern | Steps |
|---------|-------|
| `build.*house\|build.*home\|construct` | 11-step building plan (foundation → floor → walls → door → roof → decorate) |
| `mine\|diamond\|iron\|ore\|dig` | 12-step mining plan (craft pickaxe → dig → find ore → smelt) |
| `farm\|wheat\|plant\|grow\|crop` | 10-step farming plan (hoe → till → seeds → plant → water → harvest) |
| `enchant\|workshop\|alchemy\|potion\|table` | 9-step workshop plan (craft table → bookshelf → enchant → experiment) |
| `explore\|scout\|biome\|village\|find\|locate\|map` | 8-step exploration plan (scan → pick direction → scout → map) |
| (any) | 6-step generic plan (scan → gather → craft → build → expand → done) |

### Progress Tracking

- `mark_current_complete()` — marks the current goal as done, moves to next uncompleted sibling
- `current_goal` — returns the first uncompleted goal (depth-first traversal)
- `is_complete` — True when all goals in the tree are completed
- `progress` — formatted string showing the goal tree with checkmarks

## Memory System

### Short-Term Memory

A rolling deque of `ActionRecord` objects:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionRecord:
    action: str
    success: bool
    message: str
    timestamp: float
    data: dict
```

- Configurable window size (default: 20)
- Injected into every LLM prompt as structured text
- Oldest entries drop off automatically

### Long-Term Memory

A set of persistent fact strings:

- Position data from `check_position` actions
- Notable discoveries from `scan` data
- Extracted by `memory.remember_fact()` during action recording

### Summary Formatting

Short-term memory summary format:

```
[1] check_position ✓ Position: (0.0, 65.0, 0.0)
[2] scan ✓ Scanned surroundings (r=5)
[3] craft_item ✓ Gave 1 crafting_table
[4] place_block ✓ Placed crafting_table at (1, 65, 0)
[5] craft_item ✓ Gave 4 oak_planks
```

Long-term facts format:

```
Notable facts:
- Position at spawn: (0.0, 65.0, 0.0)
- Found stone below dirt at spawn
```

## State Observation

The `Observer` class gathers world state every turn:

```python
async def observe(self) -> WorldState:
    # Concurrent queries via asyncio.gather:
    pos = await self._mc.get_player_pos()
    health_raw = await self._mc.run_command_blocking("data get entity @p Health")
    inv_raw = await self._mc.run_command_blocking("data get entity @p Inventory")
    time_raw = await self._mc.get_time()
    players = await self._mc.get_players_online()
    
    # Parse health from NBT response
    health = self._parse_health(health_raw)
    
    # Multi-direction scan
    scan_data = self._scan_surroundings(pos)
    
    return WorldState(...)
```

The `format_state()` function in `prompts.py` converts this to a human-readable string for the LLM.

## Config File Priority

Configuration is resolved in this order (higher wins):

1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. YAML config file values
3. Pydantic field defaults (lowest priority)

This means you can set `MC_API_HOST=minecraft` in Docker env and it overrides whatever is in `config.yaml`.
