# ── Hardcoded fallback decompositions for common goals ────────────────
# When the LLM fails to decompose (returns nothing or non-JSON), these
# keyword-matched plans provide a sensible step-by-step breakdown.
#
# Ordering matters: the first matching pattern wins. The most specific
# patterns (nether portal, end portal, redstone, animal farm, villager
# trading) are placed FIRST so they beat the more generic "build", "farm",
# and "mine" patterns when a goal contains both keywords (e.g. "build a
# nether portal" should match the nether plan, not the generic build plan).
